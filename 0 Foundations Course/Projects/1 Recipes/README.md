# 🟪 Project 1: Recipes

## ✅ Solution + Preview ✅

* I worked on this project in the following repo: https://github.com/shivkumar98/odin-recipes

* You can preview the website here: https://shivkumar98.github.io/odin-recipes/

## 📜 Assignment 📜

* Create a new repo for this project on GitHub called `odin-recipes`

### 🔴 Iteration 1 - Initial structure

1) Create a directory called `odin-recipes`, and create a `index.html` file
2) Create a `h1` heading "Odin Recipes"

### 🔴 Iteration 2 - Recipe Page

1) Within this directory, create a directory named `recipes`
2) Create a HTML file in the recipes directory, e.g. `lasagna.html`
3) Create a `h1` heading with the recipes name
4) Within the `index.html` page, add a link to the recipe page. E.g write out `<a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>` below the heading

### 🔴 Iteration 3 - Recipe Page Content

1) An image of finished dish under h1 heading. You can find images of the dish from this [recipe site](https://www.allrecipes.com/)

2) Under the image, there should be an appreopiate sized "Description" heading followed by a paragraph describing the recipe

3) Under the Description, add an "Ingredients" heading followed by an **unordered list** of the ingredients

4) Add a "Steps" heading followed by an **ordered list** of the steps needed for the recipe.

### 🔴 Iteration 4 - Add More Recipes

1) Add two more recipes with identical page structures
2) Remember to add a link to the new recipes on the index page
