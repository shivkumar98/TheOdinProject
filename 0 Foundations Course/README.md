# 🧠 1 Prerequisites

## 🟦 1.1 How Does the Web Work

### 🔴 Introduction

* This section will provide a hollistic overview of how the web works.

### 🔴 Lesson Overview

* Describe what the internet is

* Describe what packets are and how they are used to transfer data

* Understand the differences between a web page, web server, web browser and search engine.

* Explain what a client and server is

* Explain what IP addresses and DNS servers are,

### 🔴 How Does the Internet Work?  

* The internet is a large netwrok of computers which can communicate together.

* A network between two computers can be achieved through an ethernet cable. 

* If we wanted ten computers to communicate with each other, it would not be efficient for them to all have ethernet cables going to all other computers. To solve this issue, we let the computers connect to a `router` which ensures messages are sent to the correct recieptant.

### 🔴 Difference between Webpage, Website, Web server and Search Engine?

* `Web page` - a document which can be displayed in a browser

* `Website` - A collection of web pages

* `Web server` - the host of a website

* `Search Engine` - A web service which lets you find other web pages

### 🔴 How the Web interacts

* Computers connected to the internet are called `clients` and `servers`

* We also have:

1) `Your internet connection` - allows you to send and receive data on the web

2) `TCP/IP` - The Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols are protocols which define how data is transmitted over the internet.

3) `DNS` - The Domain Name System allows the browser to find the websites IP address. This is needed for before a HTTP message is sent. The DNS is a mapping from the IP address (e.g. `63.245.215.20`) to the URL of the website

4) `HTTP` - this is a protocol which defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.

5) `Component files` - these are the front-end files and assets which makeup a website

## 🟦 1.2 Installation Overview

### 🔴 Introduction

* We will look at setting up the development environment!

* The Odin Project does not support Windows natively, so we shall look at:

- installing a supported OS
- Installing Chrome and code editor
- Creating SSH key

<br>

## 🟦 1.3 Installations

* I abandon th Linux installation and decide to just install Linux for Windows

* I open up powershell and execute:

```
PS C:\Users\shiv_> wsl --install
The requested operation requires elevation.
Installing: Virtual Machine Platform
Virtual Machine Platform has been installed.
Installing: Windows Subsystem for Linux
Windows Subsystem for Linux has been installed.
Installing: Ubuntu
Ubuntu has been installed.
The requested operation is successful. Changes will not be effective until the system is rebooted.
PS C:\Users\shiv_>
```

* I reboot my computer, and set the username and password!

* Already have VSCode installed and will use it as my code editor

<br>

## 🟦 1.4 Command Line Basics

### 🔴 Lesson Overview

* Describe what the commannd line is and open the command line on your computer

* Use the command line to navigate directories and display directory contents

* Use the command line to create a new directory and a new file

* Use the command line rename or destroy a directory and a file

* Use the command line to open a file or folder in a program

### 🔴 Assignment

1) Visit [The Unix Shell course](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) designed by the Software Carpentry Foundation. There you will find a full complement of lessons on using the CLI, but for now just focus on completing the following lessons:

  - Setup 
  - Introducing the Shell
  - Navigating Files and Directories
  - Working With Files and Directories
  - Pipes and Filters

2) With your newly discovered CLI super powers, practice creating a folder for a basic website with a main `index.html`, `style.css` and a folder for `images`.

#### 🟡 Unix Shell Course

* I work through the exercises. Here are my notes

- We can list files recursively using `-R` option

- The `-F` option adds additional information to the files to indicate if they are directory, link, executable etc

```sh
$ ls -F
LittleWomen.txt*  haiku.txt*  thesis/
```

- The `mv` command lets you specify a file and move it to a new location. E.g. here I move the `quotes.txt` in the `thesis` directory into current directory:

```sh
$ ls
LittleWomen.txt  haiku.txt  thesis
$ ls thesis/
draft.txt
$ mv thesis/draft.txt .
$ ls
LittleWomen.txt  draft.txt  haiku.txt  thesis
```

- The `mv` command also lets you rename

- The `cp` command lets you copy a file. E.g. I copy haiku.txt to /thesis

```sh
cp haiku.txt thesis/
$ ls haiku.txt thesis/haiku.txt
haiku.txt  thesis/haiku.txt
```

- We can copy a directory recursively (including files and subdirectories) using the `-r` option:

```sh
$ cp -r thesis/ thesis_backup
$ ls thesis_backup/
haiku.txt
```

- We can remove files using `rm` command:

```sh
$ rm haiku.txt
```

- We can use `rm` safely by using the `-i` option, which will require the user to confirm

```sh
$ rm -i haiku.txt
rm: remove regular empty file 'haiku.txt'? y
```

- In order to delete a directory and contents, we MUST use the recursive option `-r`:

```sh
$ ls thesis
haiku.txt
$ rm thesis
rm: cannot remove 'thesis': Is a directory
$ rm -r thesis
$ ls thesis
ls: cannot access 'thesis': No such file or directory
```

- We can copy multiple files to a directory GIVEN the final argument is a directory:

```sh
$ ls
alkanes  animal-counts  creatures  numbers.txt  project  writing
$ mkdir
 backup
$ cp creatures/minotaur.dat creatures/unicorn.dat backup/
$ ls backup/
minotaur.dat  unicorn.dat
```

- `*` is a wildcard for 0+ characters, `?` is a wildcard for 1 character exactly

- The `wc` command prints out number of lines words and characters in files:

```sh
$ pwd
/mnt/c/Users/shiv_/Documents/GitHub/TheOdinProject/0 Foundations Course/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes
$ ls
cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb
$ wc cubane.pdb
  20  156 1158 cubane.pdb
```

* We use `-l` option to just display the number of lines>:

```sh
$ wc -l *.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
   9 methane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
 107 total
```

- Which file contains the fewest lines? We can redirect the result of the `wc` command using `>`:

```sh
$ wc -l *.pdb > length.txt
$ ls
cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  length.txt  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb  propane.pdb
```

- We sort the results of the length.txt file using `sort -n` where `-n` sorts numerically:

```sh
$ sort length.txt -n
   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
 107 total
 ```

 * I use the `head` command to get the top n lines of the file:

```sh
$ sort length.txt -n > sorted-lengths.txt
$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
   9 methane.pdb
```

- We use `echo` to create text and output to a file:

```sh
$ echo this is the start of my sentence
this is the start of my sentence
$ echo hello > testFile.txt
$ echo line2 >> testFile.txt
$ head -n 2 testFile.txt
hello
line2
```

- We can use `|` pipe to pass output of one command to another:

```sh
$ sort -n length.txt
   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
 107 total
$ sort -n length.txt | head -n 1
   9 methane.pdb
```

* We can pipe consecutively:

```sh
$ wc -l *.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
   9 methane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
 107 total
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n
   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
 107 total
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1
   9 methane.pdb
```

## 🟦 1.5 Setting up Git

### 🔴 Configure Git and GitHub

#### 🟡 Setup Git

* I setup git within linux:

```sh
$ git config --global user.name "shivkumar98"
$ git config --global user.email "shiv_kumar.98@outlook.com"
```

#### 🟡 Create an SSH Key

* SSH key is a secure identifier - like a long password used to identify your machine. GitHub uses SSH key to upload tgo Github without having to use password everytime!

* I check if Ed25519 algorithm SSH key is already installed and it is not

* I create the SSH key:

```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C shiv_kumar.98@outlook.com
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/shiv/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Created directory '/home/shiv/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/shiv/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/shiv/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* I go to my Github account, and navigate to `SSH and GPG keys` and create a new key:

![](screen2023-06-06-20-04-39.png)

* I display the SSH key using:

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* I copy this and paste it in the Key section, and click `Add Key`

#### 🟡 Testing Your Key

* I follow [this article]() and test the following command, and successfully connect!:

```sh
$ ssh -T git@github.com
The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.121.4)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
Hi shivkumar98! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

# 🧠 2 Git Basics

## 🟦 2.1 Introduction to Git

### 🔴 Introduction

* Git allows you to record differences in files/folders AND keeps a historical record of each save.

* Git != Github. GitHub is a remote storage facility, Git also allows you to push projects to other platforms like GitLab, Bitbucket.
