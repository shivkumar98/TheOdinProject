* The internet is a large netwrok of computers which can communicate together.

* A network between two computers can be achieved through an ethernet cable. 

* If we wanted ten computers to communicate with each other, it would not be efficient for them to all have ethernet cables going to all other computers. To solve this issue, we let the computers connect to a `router` which ensures messages are sent to the correct recieptant.

* Computers connected to the internet are called `clients` and `servers`

* We also have:

2) `TCP/IP` - The Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols are protocols which define how data is transmitted over the internet.

3) `DNS` - The Domain Name System allows the browser to find the websites IP address. This is needed for before a HTTP message is sent. The DNS is a mapping from the IP address (e.g. `63.245.215.20`) to the URL of the website

4) `HTTP` - this is a protocol which defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.

5) `Component files` - these are the front-end files and assets which makeup a website
