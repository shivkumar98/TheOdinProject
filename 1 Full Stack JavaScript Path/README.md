# The Odin Project

* I started the Odin Project on 31/05/2023 to improve my knowledge of JavaScript

## JavaScript Path

* I started the JavaScript path on 31/05/2023, you can find my notes and project solutions here ![](/1%20Full%20Stack%20JavaScript%20Path/2%20JavaScript/README.md)

### Projects:

* View project [here](/1%20Full%20Stack%20JavaScript%20Path/2%20JavaScript/Projects/1%20Library/README.md) - I finished my first attempt of this project on 01/06/2023
* I created a small application using pure JavaScript which enables users to track the books they are reading. The data is stored within the script itself and hence does not persist.
